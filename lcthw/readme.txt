In these exercises of Learn C the Hard Way, I'm attempting to do some of the following things:

1.	Show x86 dissasembly of the C program with comments.
2.	Show x64 dissasembly of the C program with differences between it and x86.
3.	Demonstrate vulnerabilities in some of the code.
4.	Comment and demonstrate how static/dynamic linking works.
5.	Comment and demonstrate how ELF file format works.
