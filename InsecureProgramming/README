These are my local archive of insecure programming exercises from http://community.coresecurity.com/~gera/InsecureProgramming/

I've included a download of the site from the wayback machine, since it no longer exists. These are old exercises, so we need to compile them without modern stack protections:

Turn off ASLR (from shell): echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
Turn off stack protection (using gcc): compile with -fno-stack-protector 
Turn off non-executable stack (post compile): execstack -s /path/to/bin

I've separated my notes and solutions into another subdirectory to keep the exercises pure. For transparency's sake, these notes are unedited, so you can see all the messy dead ends and thought processes I've gone through.
