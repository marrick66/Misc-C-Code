<font size=-1>
What would happen if you store 512 characters where there is only space for 256?
You may claim that you can't, and you'll be right, but still, there are
situations that, unconsciously, you tell the micro to do so, and  he can only
but obey you... and he'll do his best without thinking of side effects. Now is
when we get technical, fasten your seat belts, this turbulence will last
forever.<p>
What defines a <i>buffer overflow</i> is the copy of a memory region into
another region not big enough to contain it.

This is a good and simple abo: on execution this program will copy the
contents of <code>argc[1]</code><sup>1</sup>, whatever it is, into the reserved
256 bytes named <code>buf</code>, <code>strcpy()</code> will not do any checks
of any kind, it will just copy bytes from source to destination, from <code>
argc[1]</code> to <code>buf</code>, until it finds a zero. Here, a chance is
given for us to supply a longer-than-expected <code>argc[1]</code> to write in
memory past the end of the reserved space named <code>buf</code>. Why is this
a security problem? becouse we can change data that we shouldn't be able to,
and usually, this data we can change has a very special meaning for the micro,
and by exploiting this meaning, we can confuse the micro and make it do what we
want. That's the secret, go get a debugger, a compiler, and all the tools you
think you'll need, and find out what's the data after <code>buf</code> and why
it's so important to be able to modify it.

<p>
1 - argc and argv are just names for main's arguments, they just name chunks of bits in memory, their names are not meaningful by their own but for their context.<p>
